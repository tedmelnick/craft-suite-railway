One site that serves the browser (WebAssembly) builds of 16 open-source apps by the
ArtCraft team ([storytold](https://github.com/storytold) on GitHub), plus a small relay
that lets Claude work in them. A main page groups the apps, and a guide at `/guide/`
explains how to use them.

Every app runs entirely in the browser; the server only hands over static files. Work
is saved in the browser's storage (OPFS / IndexedDB) **for that exact web address**, so
pick your address before doing real work, and export anything you care about. Chrome
or Edge is recommended (WebGPU).

## What's different in this fork

Compared with Derek's original (commit `f1420e8`, October 2026):

- **Ten more apps** (six to 16), plus a "coming soon" card for AniCraft.
- **Claude control for 15 of the 16.** The newer official releases include their own
  in-page Claude API; DesignCraft, SoundCraft, MaterialCraft and TextureCraft are built
  here from upstream source with a small patch that adds one (see "Builds" below).
- **Official releases** wherever they exist, kept as copies in this repo's GitHub
  Releases so the site doesn't depend on anyone else's downloads staying up.
- **Main page redesign** (apps grouped by kind, version list, a short Claude summary)
  and a **visitor guide** at `/guide/`.
- **A shared file "shelf"** so Claude can move files between app tabs, and an opt-in
  "also download new exports to this PC" box.
- **Relay version check:** the relay reports its version and the agent panel tells
  visitors whose own relay needs updating.
- **Free hosting on Cloudflare** (Worker + R2) alongside Railway; see `cloudflare/`.
- **Independence and trademark notices** on every page.

## Builds

App versions are pinned as `ARG`s in the `Dockerfile`, which both Railway and the
Cloudflare build read.

- **Official releases, unmodified:** LightCraft, VectorCraft, FilmCraft, EffectCraft,
  CADCraft, DeckCraft, GridCraft, FigCraft, WordCraft and Craft Anything. They are
  copied from upstream releases into this repo's releases by
  `.github/workflows/build-craft-web.yml` (entries marked `"mirror": true` in
  `.github/craft-web-builds.json`).
- **Built here with a small patch** that adds the in-page Claude API: DesignCraft,
  SoundCraft, MaterialCraft and TextureCraft (patch in `.github/craft-web-patches/`).
- **Custom builds by Derek Cheung:** PhotoCraft (`0.5.0-main4`) and PdfCraft
  (`0.5.0-main2`), first published in his repository; patches in
  `docs/photocraft-agent-api.patch` and `docs/pdfcraft-agent-api.patch`. Copies are kept
  in this repo's releases.

Server behaviour follows each app's HOSTING notes: `.wasm` as `application/wasm`,
precompressed gzip, `immutable` caching for hashed assets and `no-cache` for the rest,
COOP/COEP/CORP same-origin and `nosniff` on every response, and `/healthz` for health
checks.

## Hosting

### Railway

Two services: `craft-suite` (nginx, built from the root `Dockerfile`) and
`craft-relay` (a small Node service in `server/`). nginx forwards `/relay/` to the relay
over Railway's private network, so the in-page panel reaches it on the same address.
The relay rebuilds only when files under `server/` change.

Local test: `docker build -t craft-suite . && docker run -p 8090:8080 craft-suite`,
then open http://localhost:8090.

### Cloudflare (free)

The same site, served by a Cloudflare Worker from R2 storage, so visitors' downloads
cost nothing. Every push to `main` that touches the site republishes it
(`.github/workflows/cloudflare.yml`). The Worker forwards `/relay/` to the Railway relay.
Setup and free-plan limits are in [cloudflare/README.md](cloudflare/README.md).

## Claude: the Craft Relay

The relay exposes the browser apps to Claude as MCP tools. Claude connects to the
relay's `/mcp` address; a small panel in each app page (the ⦿ button) opens a
connection back to the relay once you click **Connect** and paste the bridge token.
Nothing connects until you do, and a Disconnect button is always visible.

**Setting up your own relay** (needed to use Claude with someone else's Craft Suite
site, whose relay belongs to its owner):

1. Fork this repo on GitHub.
2. In Railway: **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo →** your fork. In the service's
   **Settings**, set **Root Directory** to `server`.
3. In **Variables**, add `MCP_TOKEN` (32+ random characters, e.g.
   `openssl rand -base64 32`) and `BRIDGE_TOKEN` (16+ characters). Optionally set
   `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the suite's address so only that site can open bridge connections.
4. **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain.**
5. In Claude: **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, URL
   `https://<your-relay-domain>/mcp`, header `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>`.
6. On the suite site, open an app, click ⦿, set the relay address to
   `https://<your-relay-domain>`, paste your `BRIDGE_TOKEN`, and Connect.

The guide's "Using Claude" section walks through the same steps for visitors. Keep both
tokens private: anyone with `MCP_TOKEN` can drive tabs connected to your relay, and
anyone with `BRIDGE_TOKEN` can connect tabs to it. When this repo's relay changes, the
agent panel shows a notice; update your fork with GitHub's **Sync fork** button.

**Tools:** `list_sessions`, `list_commands`, `run_command`, `run_batch` (up to 20),
`inspect`, `get_image` (previews up to 1 MB), `list_files`, `get_file` (small files),
`send_file` (upload a file from the app to a URL you give, so large media never enters
the conversation) and `put_file` (import into the app from base64 or a URL the page
fetches). Each app's adapter is in `bridge/adapters.js`.

**Moving files between apps (the shelf).** Every app is served from the same address,
so their tabs share one browser store. `send_file` with url `https://shelf/<name>` puts
a file on the shelf; `put_file` with that url in another tab imports it; `list_files`
lists shelf entries. Files stay in the browser, never on the relay or in the
conversation.

**Note on EffectCraft and FilmCraft:** both answer Claude on their drawing loop. Keep
the tab visible; in a hidden tab, commands wait until the relay's 20-second timeout.

**Safety:** token-protected MCP; origin-checked, token-gated bridge connections; a
denylist of destructive commands; a read-only switch and Disconnect in the page; 10
calls a second, 20-second timeout, at most 5 tabs; no parameters or images in relay
logs. While connected, Claude can act only in that tab, and the page shows that it is
connected.

The relay's original design is Derek Cheung's: see `PRD.md` and
`docs/PRD-Craft-Relay.pdf`.

  independent community project, not made, sponsored or endorsed by the ArtCraft team.
